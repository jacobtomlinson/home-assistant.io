To run Dashing and `hapush` at reboot, I have provided sample init scripts in the `./init` directory. These have been tested on a Raspberry PI - your mileage may vary on other systems.

Instructions for automaticaly starting a docker install can be found (here)[https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/host_integration/].

For docker you may also want to use docker-compose - there is a sample compose file in the `./init` directory.
