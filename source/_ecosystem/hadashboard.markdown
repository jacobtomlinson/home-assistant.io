HADashboard is a dashboard for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) that is intended to be wall mounted, and is optimized for distance viewing.

HADashboard was originally created by the excellent work of [FlorianZ](https://github.com/FlorianZ/hadashboard) for use with the SmartThings Home Automation system, with notable contributions from the [SmartThings Community](https://community.smartthings.com/t/home-automation-dashboard/4926). I would also like to acknowledge contributions made by [zipriddy](https://github.com/zpriddy/SmartThings_PyDash). This is my port of hadashboard to Home Assistant.
