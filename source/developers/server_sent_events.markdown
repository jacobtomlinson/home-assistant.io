The [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) feature is a one-way channel from your Home Assistant server to a client which is acting as a consumer. For bi-directional communication check the [RESTful API](/developers/rest_api/) and [Python API](/developers/python_api/).

The URI that is generating the data is `/api/stream`.

A requirement on the client-side is existing support for the [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) interface.

There are various ways to access the stream. One is `curl`:

```bash
$ curl -X GET -H "x-ha-access: YOUR_PASSWORD" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8123/api/stream
```

For more comfort put the HTML snippet below in a file `sse.html` in your `www` folder of your Home Assistant configuration directory (`.homeassistant`)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>Getting Home Assistant server events</h1>
    <div id="events"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var source = new EventSource("/api/stream");
        source.onmessage = function(event) {
            document.getElementById("events").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
        };
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Visit [http://localhost:8123/local/sse.html](http://localhost:8123/local/sse.html) to see the stream of events.
