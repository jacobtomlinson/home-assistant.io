Home Assistant requires the Raspberry Pi to run [Raspbian Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). This version was released on September 24, 2015 and comes by default with Python 3.4 which is required for Home Assistant.

Execute the following code in a console:

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install homeassistant
$ hass
```

Running these commands will:

 - Install Home Assistant
 - Launch Home Assistant and serve the web interface on [http://localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123)
