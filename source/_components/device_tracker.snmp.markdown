A lot WiFi access points and WiFi routers support the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). This is a standardized method for monitoring/manageing network connected devices. SNMP uses a tree-like hierarchy where each node is an object. Many of these objects contain (live) lists of insances and metrics, like network interfaces, disks, and wifi registrations.

<p class='note warning'>
This device tracker needs SNMP to be enabled on the router.

OID examples:
- Mikrotik: `1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.1.2.1.1` (confirmed, unknown RouterOS version/model)
- Mikrotik: `1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2` (confirmed, RouterOS 6.x on RB2011)
- Aruba: `1.3.6.1.4.1.14823.2.3.3.1.2.4.1.2` (untested)
- BiPAC 7800DXL: `1.3.6.1.2.1.17.7.1.2.2.1.1` (confirmed on firmware 2.32e)
- OpenWrt: `1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2` (tested on Chaos Calmer 15.05 firmware, need to install snmpd package)
- pfSense: `1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2` (tested on 2.2.4-RELEASE, need to enable SNMP service)

To use the SNMP platform in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  platform: snmp
  host: 192.168.1.1
  community: public
  baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.1.2.1.1
```
Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): The IP address of the router, eg. 192.168.1.1.
- **community** (*Required*): The SNMP community which is set for the device. Most devices have a default community set to to `public` with read-only permission (which is sufficient).
- **baseoid** (*Required*): The OID prefix where wireless client registrations can be found, usually vendor specific. It's advised to use the numerical notation. To find this base OID, check vendor documentation or check the MIB file for your device.

See the [device tracker component page](/components/device_tracker/) for instructions how to configure the people to be tracked.
