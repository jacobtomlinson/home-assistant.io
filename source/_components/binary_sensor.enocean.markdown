This can typically be one of those batteryless wall switches. Currently only one type has been tested: Eltako FT55. Other devices will most likely not work without changing the Home-Asisstant code.


To use your EnOcean device, you first have to set up your [EnOcean hub](../enocean) and then add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: enocean
    id: [0x01,0x90,0x84,0x3C]
```

Configuration variables:

- **id** (*Required*): The ID of the device. This is the 4 bytes long number written on the dimmer.
- **platform** (*Required*): Set to `enocean`.
