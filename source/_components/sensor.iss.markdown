The `iss` platform uses the [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/) to let you know if the station is above your home location. This means that ISS is 10Â° above the horizon of your home.
You can check in the attributes of the sensor how many minutes you have to wait until the next rise of the station and the number of people in space.

To add ISS sensor to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: iss
```
