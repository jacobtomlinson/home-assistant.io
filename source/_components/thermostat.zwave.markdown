To get your Z-Wave thermostat working with Home Assistant, follow the instructions for the general [Z-Wave component](/components/zwave/).

<p class='note'>
If your thermostat support fan modes or different operating modes, it should be considered a [HVAC component](/components/hvac.zwave/), and will also be detected as one. Thermostat component does not support setting fan or operation mode. This is controlled via the HVAC component.

If the thermostat support different operationg modes, you will get one thermostat entity for each mode. These can be hidden with settings using the customize setting in the `configuration.yaml` file.
