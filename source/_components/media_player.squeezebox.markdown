The Squeezebox platform allows you to control a [Logitech Squeezebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezebox_%28network_music_player%29) music player from Home Assistant.
This lets you control Squeezebox hardware like the Classic, Transporter, Duet, Boom, Radio and Touch and of software players like [SoftSqueeze](http://softsqueeze.sourceforge.net/), [SqueezePlayer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bluegaspode.squeezeplayer) and [SqueezeSlave](http://forums.slimdevices.com/showthread.php?93607-ANNOUNCE-Squeezeslave-1-2-released).

To add your Squeezebox player to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  platform: squeezebox
  host: IP_ADDRESS
  port: 9090
  username: USERNAME
  password: PASSWORD
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): The host name or address of the Logitech Media Server, eg. 192.168.1.21.
- **port** (*Optional*): Telnet port to Logitech Media Server, default 9090.
- **username** (*Optional*): The username, if password protection is enabled.
- **password** (*Optional*): The password, if password protection is enabled.
