The `wemo` component is the main component to integrate various [Belkin WeMo](http://www.belkin.com/us/Products/home-automation/c/wemo-home-automation/) devices with Home Assistant.

Supported devices will be automatically discovered if the discovery component is enabled. If you are not using the discovery component, loading the `wemo` component will scan for WeMo devices on the local network.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
wemo:
```

Alternately, WeMo devices that are not discoverable can be statically configured. If you have WeMo devices on subnets other than where Home Assistant is running, and/or devices in a remote location reachable over a VPN, you will need to manually configure them. This is also useful if you wish to disable discovery for some wemos, even if they are local. Example static configuration:

```yaml
wemo:
  static:
    - 192.168.1.23
    - 192.168.52.172
```

Any WeMo devices that are not statically configured but reachable via discovery will still be added automatically.

Note that if you use this, you may want to configure your router (or whatever runs your DHCP server) to force your WeMo devices to use a static IP address. Check the DHCP section of your router configuration for this ability.
