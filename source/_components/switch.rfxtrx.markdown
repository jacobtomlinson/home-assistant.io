The `rfxtrx` platform support switches that communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.

First you have to set up your [rfxtrx hub.](/components/rfxtrx/)
The easiest way to find your switches is to add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
switch:
 platform: rfxtrx
 automatic_add: True
```

Launch your homeassistant and go the website.
Push your remote and your device should be added:

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/components/rfxtrx/switch.png' />
</p>

Here the name is 0b11000102ef9f210010f70 and you can verify that it works from the frontend. 
Then you should update your configuration to:

```yaml
switch:
 platform: rfxtrx
 devices:
    0b11000102ef9f210010f70: 
        name: device_name
```

Example configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch: 
 platform: rfxtrx
 automatic_add: False
 signal_repetitions: 2
 devices:
   0b1100ce3213c7f210010f70:
     name: Movment1
   0b11000a02ef2gf210010f50:
     name: Movment2
   0b1111e003af16aa10000060:
     name: Door
```

Configuration variables:

- **devices** (*Required*): A list of devices with their name to use in the frontend.
- **automatic_add** (*Optional*): To enable the automatic addition of new switches.
- **signal_repetitions** *Optional*: Because the rxftrx device sends its actions via radio and from most receivers it's impossible to know if the signal was received or not. Therefore you can configure the switch to try to send each signal repeatedly.
- **fire_event** *Optional*: Fires an event even if the state is the same as before. Can be used for automations.
